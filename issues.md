# Code Review Issues

## Summary

This code review examines the ZenOrganizer project, a Python async service combining a Telegram bot with FastAPI and AI agents. The overall architecture is well-designed with good separation of concerns, but several areas need improvement.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Python Version Requirement
**Location**: `uv.lock:3`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Requires Python >= 3.13, which is very recent and may not be widely available in all environments.
**Impact**: Deployment limitations, compatibility issues with older systems.
**Recommendation**: Consider supporting Python 3.11+ for broader compatibility.

### 2. Missing Environment Variable Validation
**Location**: `zeno/agents.py:54-65`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: `get_openai_model()` accesses environment variables directly without validation.
**Impact**: Runtime crashes when required environment variables are missing.
**Recommendation**: Add proper validation with helpful error messages.

### 3. Inconsistent Error Handling in Tools
**Location**: `zeno/tools.py:33-79`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Tool functions don't return the ID for created/updated memories despite docstring claims.
**Impact**: Agents cannot track which memory they just created/updated.
**Recommendation**: Fix return values to match documentation.

## Architecture & Design Issues

### 4. Threading Model Concerns
**Location**: `main.py:41-134`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Multiple daemon threads with separate event loops can lead to complexity.
**Impact**: Potential race conditions, debugging difficulties.
**Recommendation**: Consider using a single asyncio event loop with structured concurrency.

### 5. In-Memory Task Storage
**Location**: `zeno/api.py:21-28`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Task registry uses in-memory storage that doesn't survive restarts.
**Impact**: Background tasks are lost on server restart, no persistence.
**Recommendation**: Add persistent task storage or clarify this is intentional behavior.

### 6. Missing Rate Limiting
**Location**: `zeno/api.py`, `zeno/telegram_bot.py`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: No rate limiting on API endpoints or Telegram message handling.
**Impact**: Vulnerable to abuse, potential resource exhaustion.
**Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting for both API and bot endpoints.

## Code Quality Issues

### 7. Long Agent Instructions
**Location**: `zeno/agents.py:72-237`
**Severity**: Low
**Issue**: Agent instruction strings are very long and embedded in code.
**Impact**: Difficult to maintain, hard to read.
**Recommendation**: Move instruction templates to separate files or use a templating system.

### 8. Missing Type Hints
**Location**: Multiple files
**Severity**: Low
**Issue**: Some functions lack complete type hints.
**Impact**: Reduced IDE support, harder to understand expected types.
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive type hints throughout.

### 9. Complex Message Splitting Logic
**Location**: `zeno/utils.py:10-84`
**Severity**: Low
**Issue**: `split_and_send` function is complex with nested error handling.
**Impact**: Difficult to maintain and test.
**Recommendation**: Simplify the logic and separate concerns.

## Security Issues

### 10. Database File Permissions
**Location**: `zeno/storage.py:20-32`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: Database directory creation doesn't set proper permissions.
**Impact**: Potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.
**Recommendation**: Set appropriate file permissions when creating directories.

### 11. No Input Sanitization
**Location**: `zeno/telegram_bot.py:31-70`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: User messages are passed directly to AI agent without sanitization.
**Impact**: Potential prompt injection attacks.
**Recommendation**: Add input validation and sanitization.

## Testing Issues

### 12. Limited Test Coverage
**Location**: `tests/`
**Severity**: High
**Issue**: Only basic API endpoint tests exist, missing coverage for core functionality.
**Impact**: High risk of undetected bugs, especially in agent logic and database operations.
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### 13. Missing Integration Tests
**Location**: tests/
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: No tests for the full telegram bot flow or agent interactions.
**Impact**: End-to-end functionality not verified.
**Recommendation**: Add integration tests covering complete user workflows.

## Performance Issues

### 14. Inefficient Memory Loading
**Location**: `zeno/agents.py:37-51`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: `get_memories_prompt()` loads all memories for every agent invocation.
**Impact**: Performance degradation as memory count grows.
**Recommendation**: Implement pagination or filtering for memory loading.

### 15. Synchronous Database Operations in Bot
**Location**: `zeno/telegram_bot.py:59-63`
**Severity**: Low
**Issue**: Multiple database calls made sequentially during message processing.
**Impact**: Increased response latency.
**Recommendation**: Consider batching or optimizing database access patterns.

## Documentation Issues

### 16. Missing API Documentation
**Location**: `zeno/api.py`
**Severity**: Medium
**Issue**: FastAPI endpoints lack proper OpenAPI documentation.
**Impact**: Difficult for developers to understand and use the API.
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive docstrings and OpenAPI annotations.

### 17. Inconsistent Code Comments
**Location**: Multiple files
**Severity**: Low
**Issue**: Mix of comment styles and inconsistent documentation quality.
**Impact**: Reduced code maintainability.
**Recommendation**: Standardize comment style and improve documentation.

## Dependencies Issues

### 18. Large Dependency Footprint
**Location**: `uv.lock`
**Severity**: Low
**Issue**: Many dependencies, some potentially unnecessary.
**Impact**: Larger deployment size, more security surface area.
**Recommendation**: Audit dependencies and remove unused ones.

## Recommendations by Priority
