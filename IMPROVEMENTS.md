# Project Improvement Analysis

This document outlines potential improvements and identified bad practices in the zeno project.

## 1. Configuration and Tooling

### `pyproject.toml`

- **Metadata:** The project includes `description`, `authors`, and `urls` in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Dependencies:** The dependencies are well-defined and `uv` is used for dependency management.
- **Tool Configuration:**
    - **Ruff:** `ruff` is included in the development dependencies; consider reviewing ignored rules for stricter code quality.
    - **Ty:** The `ty` configuration may be verbose; consider cleaning defaults and ensuring `tests/` are included in type checks.

### `justfile`

- The `justfile` provides useful commands for formatting, checking, running the application, and includes a `test` command that runs `pytest`.

### `README.md`

- The `README.md` contains project description, setup instructions, and usage examples.

## 2. Code Quality and Static Analysis

The `just check` command passed, which is good. However, this only means that the code adheres to the current (and potentially lenient) rules.

## 3. Testing

A search for test files revealed that there are **no tests** in this project. This is a major issue that should be addressed.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are some recommendations for improving the project:

1.  **Add Tests:**
    - Create a `tests/` directory.
    - Add unit and integration tests for the application's features.
    - Use a test runner like `pytest`.
    - Add a `test` command to the `justfile` to run the tests.

2.  **Improve Tooling Configuration:**
    - **`pyproject.toml`:**
        - Add a proper description and other metadata.
        - Review the ignored `ruff` rules and re-enable some of them (e.g., docstring rules).
        - Clean up the `[tool.ty]` section by removing the default values.
        - Remove `tests/` from the `exclude` list in `[tool.ty]`.
        - Add `pytest` to the `dev-dependencies`.
    - **`justfile`:**
        - Add a `test` command: `test:
    uvx pytest`.

3.  **Improve Docker Setup:**
    - Add a service for the `zeno` application to the `docker-compose.yml` file. This will make it easier to run the application in a containerized environment.

4.  **Improve Documentation:**
    - Fill out the `README.md` file with a project description, setup instructions, and usage examples.
